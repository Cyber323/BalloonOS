This is a Work-In-Progress distro. Many things may be broken. I am not responsible if this corrupts or removes your files in any way.

This distro does not have any custom repos yet. This distro is basically vanilla arch with a lot of apps packed inside for recovery, tools, games, and even some apps for daily driving this distro incase your disk dies and you just have a USB to put an OS on.
